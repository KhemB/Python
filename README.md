In the code cell below, write Python code to accomplish the following using what you've learned through Chapter 2. Prompt the user to enter a whole dollar amount (from 1 - 99 for this application) to be withdrawn from our virtual ATM. Use the input-gathering techniques demonstrated in Section 2.6 to gather this input. For the moment, you may assume that the user follows your directions for the input (namely, entering an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive). Calculate and print the number of bills of each denomination (twenties, tens, fives, and ones) that should be dispensed, minimizing the total number of bills used. Start with twenties and work your way down to ones. If no bills of a particular denomination are needed, skip that bill in the output using if statements as demonstrated in Section 2.7 of the text.

Exercise 3.11, p. 113 (Miles Per Gallon) Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. Develop a sentinel-controlled-repetition script that prompts the user to input the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful. The script should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each tankful. After processing all input information, the script should calculate and display the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfuls (that is, total miles driven divided by total gallons used). Sample output appears below.

Exercise 4.9, p. 152 (Temperature Conversion) Implement a fahrenheit function that returns the Fahrenheit equivalent of a Celsius temperature. Use the following formula:
F = (9 / 5) * C + 32
Use this function to print a chart showing the Fahrenheit equivalents of all Celsius temperatures in the range 0â€“100 degrees. Use one digit of precision for the results. Print the outputs in a neat tabular format.
Note: Feel free to change the function's name to something more verb-oriented, such as convert_C_to_F. The function should only return the calculated Fahrenheit temperature - it is not asked to print the value. The output table is printed in the application code by calling the function repeatedly from within a counter-controlled loop.
